## 🚀 About Me

💻 Software Engineer with experience building **scalable backend systems, cloud-native applications, and data-driven solutions**.
I enjoy designing architectures that integrate services efficiently, process information reliably, and solve real-world problems from idea to production.

My experience includes:

* Backend development with **Python (FastAPI, Django)**
* **Cloud & DevOps** using AWS, Azure, Docker and CI/CD
* **Data pipelines and ETL processes** for analytics and business intelligence
* **Distributed systems and messaging architectures** (RabbitMQ, microservices)

I am passionate about continuous learning, system design, and building reliable technology.
